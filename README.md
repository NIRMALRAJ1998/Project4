**DS_Airbnb_Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings data using MongoDB Atlas for storage, Streamlit for building an interactive web application, and dynamic visualizations for exploring various aspects of the data. The analysis focuses on pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The ultimate goal is to provide a clear and user-friendly dashboard for exploring the dataset and gaining valuable insights into Airbnb's performance across different regions.

**Key Objectives**
Data Collection & Storage: Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas to retrieve and store the Airbnb dataset for efficient analysis.
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring proper data types for accurate analysis.
Geospatial Visualizations: Develop interactive maps using Streamlit to showcase the distribution of Airbnb listings, including key features like prices, ratings, and availability.
Price Analysis: Analyze price variations across different locations, property types, and seasons, using dynamic plots and charts for detailed insights.
Availability Patterns: Visualize seasonal occupancy rates and demand fluctuations, offering insights into Airbnb booking trends.
Location-Based Insights: Extract and analyze data for specific neighborhoods or regions, providing deeper insights into Airbnb's local performance.
Interactive Visualizations: Allow users to filter and drill down into the data for a customized exploration experience.
Comprehensive Dashboard: Build a Tableau/Power BI dashboard integrating multiple visualizations to present key findings from the analysis.

**Technologies Used**
MongoDB Atlas: Cloud database for storing Airbnb data.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications.
Python: Main programming language for data analysis and web app development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly: Libraries for creating dynamic plots and visualizations.
Tableau/Power BI: For building a comprehensive data dashboard.

**How to Use**
